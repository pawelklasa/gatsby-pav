A custom, image-centric theme for Gatsby. Made for publishers and portfolios with plenty of graphics to show off to the world. Completely free and fully responsive, released under the MIT license.



1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use `npx` and the Gatsby CLI to create a new project

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    npx gatsby new my-awesome-portfolio https://github.com/ImedAdel/gatsby-london
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-awesome-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
